# 2d procedural dungeon generator

This project is a two-dimensional procedural dungeon generator developed as part of my thesis. The generator creates random dungeon levels, which can be visualized using custom sprites and tile palettes. To achieve unique level generation, it employs procedural algorithms such as binary space partitioning, random walk, and pseudo-random number generation.
